If you are given the value of N(always even) and an NxN matrix and you are allowed to reverse all its rows and columns, together or separately, any number of times, find the maximum possible sum of the upper left quadrant. Upper left quadrant : upper left square of N/2 length.

Example
Input:
1 5 7 8
0 9 7 3
4 5 6 8
9 9 9 9
Output:
35

Upon repeated reversing, the upper left 2x2 square can be brought to the state
9 9
8 9
which is equal to 35
Order of reversing here:
R3, C1, C2, R4, C2

Constraint
N is even
All elements of the matrix are positive

Input Format
4
1 5 7 8
0 9 7 3
4 5 6 8
9 9 9 9 

Output Format
35
